        Service Call (Includes 1 hours labour):
      </h3>
      <h4>Cost: £68.00</h4>
      <p class="description">
        If my services are considerably less than an hour and a quick service
        visit is all that's required, by all means I would not charge £68.00. A
        discount will be offered. Additional half hours labour is charged at
        £34.00.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Please note that we do not charge a call out fee for our local working
        area (generally 15 mile radius of Horsham) whilst carrying out
        estimates.
        <br />
        A fee will be charged for "Out of Area" destinations (at my discretion)
        and diagnostics services.

      <h4 class="description mobile-margin">
        We typically supply & install: UHF wideband aerials for "Freeview"
        terrestrial reception.
      </h4>
      <p class="description">
        Average cost: Wide band digital compatible UHF aerial, up-to 6ft heavy
        gauge alloy mast, 6-9" galvanized wall or chimney fittings, up-to 25
        meters coaxial cable (colour: brown, white or black), approximately 1.5
        hours labour, coaxial plug, set-up & re-tune/demonstration.
      </p>
      <h4>Total estimated cost: £222.00</h4>
      <h4>Loft mounted installations estimated cost: £188.00</h4>
      <p class="description">
        The final cost may be higher or lower depending upon the signals
        received. If the required signal levels are not received then additional
        materials/labour may be required i.e. taller mast or signal
        amplification. Please note that if there is necessity to acquire
        additional signal levels then I would seek correct approval/permission
        prior to any un-foreseen expense.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Please note: Television receiving aerials provide optimum reception via
        a clear signal path from their mounted position to designated
        transmitter, if the line of sight to transmitter is obstructed by
        trees/buildings etc, additional mast length/signal amplification may be
        required.

      <p class="description">
        Omni directional (receives signals via 360 degrees) or multi elements
        for directional reception and to acquire increased signal levels We
        commonly install omni directional radio aerials as they are more
        discrete in size and produce the appropriate signal reception within the
        local area (Horsham).
